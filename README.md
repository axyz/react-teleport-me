# react-teleport-me

React component to teleport component render to body.

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install react-teleport-me --save
```
## Usage
```jsx
import Teleport from 'react-teleport-me';

class App extends Component {
    render = () => {
        const {
            active,
        } = this.props;

        return active ? (
            <Teleport>
                <section
                    className="app">
                    Hello There
                </section>
            </Teleport>
            ) : null;
    }
}
```

You can set the `lockBody` property to `true` to add the `zvui_teleport-lock` class to the body.
Then in your App you can set `overflow: hidden` to that class in order to prevent body scrolling.
